# Add new
To add a new feature it needs to create the appropriate folder
(the folder name is the feature name) with the following files:
- run.js: that's the NodeJS code to perform your wishes
- conf.json: that's the configuration file of your feature

To be accessible from the main configuration file, it can be also
interesting to overload the feature configuration in the main file.
In that case you can just copy/paste the interesting part of your local
configuration in the main configuration file.
